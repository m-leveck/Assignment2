## Saw My Favourite Band in Concert
This September, I saw my favorite band "Vampire Weekend" in concert. 

I really loved hearing their songs live. I was very impressed with how many instruments they could play. 

My favorite memory meeting up with my friends and singing along to all their music. 

I did like how rainy it was. It was an outdoor concert. We got soaked!

Overall, I would give this experience an A+. I need to do it again!
