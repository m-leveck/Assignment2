## Moved into Residence
In first year, I moved into residence to go to Laurier Brantford. 

I really liked meeting new people. 

My favorite memory was meeting my roommates for the first time. We are such good friends!

I did not like how boring Brantford can be. I find myself going home to Waterloo a lot. 

Overall, I would give this experience an B-. It was fine, but I would not want to do it again.
