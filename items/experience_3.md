## Got Involved in High School Leadership
In Grade 12, I ran my high school's Instagram page. 

I had lots of fun doing this and met one of my best friends! I got to be creative and come up with new ideas and I think it really influenced the things I like doing now. My first taste into designing a good user experience! 

My favorite memory was thinking of new ideas and strategies for our posts. 

Although I understand why, I did not like how long it took for things to be approved to be posted. 

Overall, I would give this experience an A. I have very fond memories of it.
