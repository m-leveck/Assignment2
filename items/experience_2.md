## Cross Country
I ran cross country in high school.

I really liked running in the nice trails by my school. It was always so pretty in the fall.  

My favorite memory was "popsicle Fridays". We got popsicles after our Friday workout. 

I did not like running sometimes. 

Overall, I would give this experience an A! It was lots of fun.
