## Lifeguard
I worked as a lifeguard last summer. 

I really liked hanging out with the kids and teaching swimming lessons. 

My favorite memory was dressing up for "Halloween Night" in July. 

I did not like how hot it got some days. It made me so tired. 

Overall, I would give this experience an A+! It could not have been better.
